I had such a fantastic time with my fellow campers to explore the latest thoughts and learnings of mechanism design for DAOs. I got lots of inspirations for my project's mission to build the right reputation mechanisms for decentralized systems. But most importantly, I met the right people for building together.",

But the real magic at is in the curated participants, which offered great mental stimulation as well - The unconference sessions allowed me to nerd out in paradise with my favorite DAO frens. The vibes were high at an all time high and I'll be back next year, because MetaCamp is 1337.",
